Review: The book itself is very well done! Rick Baker hops right on stage and introduces you to digital sculpting with a warning that I wish I was given when I first jumped in. He warns not to get involved if your not ready only because once invested you'll never put it down. Be ready for this to revolutionize your ability to produce. ZBrush is dynamic at best. It grants you the freedom to create, something artists at any level can appreciate!

From that I can say this, ZBrush has made my job turn from intolerable to exciting!

Paul Gaboury was ever present with such a large part of my learning of ZBrush fundamentals! Another good book involving Paul you should buy is

Title: .0 out of 5 stars Long on techniques, short on offering understanding
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on June 30, 2012
Review: A lot depends on your leaning style. This book is a compendium of lots of things you can do with the tool. It's of the often used style "use these settings, click this button, and look ... it is almost as complete as the picture in the book." (baseball hat for example) "Fool around with other settings till you get the hang of it."

If you want to understand underlying concepts, principals and reasoning in order to know something about the intentions of the tool's design and how one method might be more useful than another, this book doesn't shed much light on what is going on. Nor does it tell you how to make perfect UVs apparently so needed for Noisemaker. They are on the disc to save time.

Pixologic's own documentation is always a little opaque. It has gotten better with the new guide to 4R3, but the documentation expects you to want to know something based on the version release, rather than on what the numbers in the settings mean. (are they degrees, days to Christmas, or parsecs?) Too bad.

ZBrush is a moving target, as it evolves, new features supercede legacy methods, but after all, the users are "Artists dammit", and don't really need to understand the complexities of the zillions of parameters in the tool.

The company relies on experienced users like Michael Pavlovich (Eat3D DVDs or on Zclassroom, or Geert Melis, (his real tut is hidden on this book's DVD) to take you out with ZBrush and show you what this baby can do.

Since the author is lead application engineer for Pixologic, I had hoped for more of "what's under the hood" in the manner of Ryan Kingslien's work. Oh well, the "ZBrush Secret Decoder Ring" still awaits writing.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars A Must Have written by a master of ZBrush
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on June 21, 2012
Review: An excellent book written for the more experienced ZBrush artists, and should also be purchased by those serious about creating in ZBrush. It is full of practical professional tips and techniques. The text, numerous images in the book and accompanying DVD explain in great detail `how to do it' step by step presented by a master with contributing experts. The contents of the DVD can be downloaded to a hard drive for ease of opening assets in ZBrush. The DVD includes videos, project files, tools, and more. The `take-home' value of the book and DVD far exceed the cost. Paul Gaboury's book is a valuable resource for beginners to see creative applications; however, the author assumes the reader has a basic understanding of ZBrush. "Introduction to ZBrush" 3rd edition, by Eric Keller is an excellent reference with tutorials to learn the basics that are not covered in this book. ZBrush Classroom and the documentation shipped with ZBrush are other resources to learn to use the software.

Review: This book is excellent in that it works exactly as advertised. "Zbrush Professional Tips and Techniques" tops my 3 foot high stack of Zbrush books and is my go to guide for difficult modeling problem solutions. The writing style is direct, approachable and without pretense. Anyone actually serious about learning Zbrush which is both a both powerful, fantastic but yet sometimes not always intuitive should get this book right away. Paul Gaboury is proficient at presenting a clear and concise approach to mastering the Zbrush interface and achieving immediate and satisfying results. If I could squish this book along with Eric Keller's "

Review: I am new to Zbrush. The more I use the program, the more questions I have. So I often stop my project and search for answers on line.
"Zbrush, Professional Tips + Techniques" is a great sources to answer my questions and teach me new techniques.
I browsed the book from cover to cover at first, and found so many interesting projects listed in the book. Right now, I am reading word by word and follow the instruction to do the projects. I am sure I will learn a great deals from these experts.
Mr. Paul Gaboury's writing is simple, clear and easy to follow. When I had a question, I sent an email to him. Within five hours, I received my answer. Like I have a personal trainer. How cool is it?
The CD included is helpful too. So do watch it.
Thank you Mr. Gaboury for the great book.
